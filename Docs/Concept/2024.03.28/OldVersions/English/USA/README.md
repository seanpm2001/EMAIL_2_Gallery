EMAIL 2 Gallery
Idea inspired by the HEY! Mail client by Basecamp, a bad email client (IMO) but a good idea

Concept:
EMAIL attachments can be saved to a special gallery that is easy to browse, instead of going email through email, finding attachments.
The gallery can be sorted by media type, file type, date, receiver, read, unread, and more.
The gallery can be put into offline storage
The gallery can be enabled/disabled
The gallery does not use up additional account space

Taking 2 ideas from a bad email client I found, and adding them to the EMAIL 2 standard, with many improvements (they are good ideas, but HEY! Mail by Basecamp is not a very good EMAIL client, as it is closed source, requires a $99/month subscription, and disallows you from using another email provider. I found its screening and attachment libraries good ideas that should be available to everyone, and I improved on them in my standard draft.
